# FISCO BCOS One-Click Installation Manual

[中文版本：一键快速安装部署](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/tree/master/sample)

This manual helps FISCO BCOS beginners get started quickly.  FISCO BCOS provides automation scripts to help you install and deploy FISCO BCOS easily.

## Notes:
1. The installation environment shall meet the prerequisties of FISCO BCOS.[（FISCO BCOS Manual 1.1）](../doc/manual/README.md);
2. One-Click installation script (build.sh) is applicable to CentOS and Ubuntu;
3. Make sure *yum* & *git* are installed on your Linux;
4. If you fail to download the dependencies when running *build.sh*, it is most likely due to the network condition. Please delete all the git-cloned contents of FISCO BCOS, and git clone again. After that, please find and download the relevant dependencies in https://github.com/bcosorg/lib and copy them to the corresponding directories. Then run *build.sh* again;  
5. In some steps, root password is required.

## Installation and Deployment

1. **Download source code**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/fisco-bcos/fisco-bcos
   ```

2. **Run *build.sh***

   ```shell
   $ cd fisco-bcos
   $ chmod +x build.sh 
   $ ./build.sh
   ```
      The following message indicates FISCO BCOS has been installed sucessfully.
   ```
   fisco-bcos build succ! path: /usr/local/bin/fisco-bcos
   ```

   Tips: the path of the executable files: /usr/local/bin/fisco-bcos


## Deployment of two nodes on one single server

This part will help deploy a two-node blockchain network. The two nodes are in the same server and connected with each other to constitute a blockchain.

1. **Run**

   ```shell
   cd sample
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

2. **Verify the nodes**

   **Verify the process**

   > Execute the following command:

   ```shell
   ps -ef |grep fisco-bcos
   ```

   > The following message inidicates that the 2 nodes are running

   ```
   root  6226  6225  3 17:22 pts/2    00:00:02 fisco-bcos --genesis /bcos-data/node1/genesis.json --config /bcos-data/node1/config.json
   root  6227  6224  3 17:22 pts/2    00:00:02 fisco-bcos --genesis /bcos-data/node0/genesis.json --config /bcos-data/node0/config.json
   ```

   **（2）Verify the connection**

   > Execute the following command:

   ```shell
   cat /bcos-data/node0/log/* | grep peers
   ```

   > The following message indicates the two nodes are connected with each other successfully. 

   ```shell
   INFO|2017-11-22 17:22:06|Connected to 1 peers
   ```

   **（3）Verify the consensus mechanism**

   > Execute the following command:

   ```shell
   tail -f /bcos-data/node0/log/* | grep ++++
   ```

   > If the nodes are installed successfully, their logs will print the following message periodically. This means that the nodes are reaching consensus periodically.

   ```log

## Deployment of 4 nodes on two servers

This section introduces how to deploy a 4-node FISCO BCOS. Among which two nodes are installed on one server and the other two nodes are installed on the other one. 4 nodes are connected with each other, constitute a 4-node blockchain.

Suppose 2 server are provided, the IP of one server with FISCO BCOS installed is 192.168.1.101, the onther one's IP is 192.168.1.102.

1. **Deploy  software dependencies**

   > Install the required software with the following command: 

   ```shell
   yum -y -q install epel-release
   yum install -y leveldb-devel libmicrohttpd-devel
   ```

2. **Deploy the nodes **

   > Execute the following commands on the server which has already deployed FISCO BCOS (192.168.1.101)

   ```sh
   cd sample
   ./init_four.sh  192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102 #Local IP first
   #two nodes will be deployed on "192.168.1.101" and a node-installation package for another server 192.168.1.102 will be genearted, name of generated package is 192.168.1.102_install.tar.gz
   scp 192.168.1.102_install.tar.gz app@192.168.1.102:/home/app/ #Copy the installation package to any directory of the other server(192.168.1.102).
   ```

3. **Start the nodes**

   **（1）For the server with FISCO BCOS**

   ```sh
   cd sample
   ./start_two.sh
   ```

   **（2）For the other server**

   ```sh
   cd /home/app/
   tar -zxvf 192.168.1.102_install.tar.gz
   cd 192.168.1.102_install
   chmod +x start_two.sh
   ./start_two.sh
   ```

4. **Check the nodes**

   **（1）Check the process**

   > Execute the following command on the two servers:

   ```sh
   ps -ef |grep fisco-bcos
   ```

   > The following message indicates that the server has started two nodes successfully.

   ```
   root 30038 30037  1 17:16 pts/0    00:00:07 fisco-bcos --genesis /bcos-data/node4_3/genesis.json --config /bcos-data/node4_3/config.json
   root 30039 30036  1 17:16 pts/0    00:00:07 fisco-bcos --genesis /bcos-data/node4_2/genesis.json --config /bcos-data/node4_2/config.json
   ```

   **（2）Verify the network connection**

   > Execute the following comand on the latest-started server (For example, we start 192.168.1.101 firstly and then 192.168.1.102. Now we should execute the command on 192.168.1.102).

   ```sh
   cat /bcos-data/node4_*/log/* | grep peers
   ```

   > The following logs show that every node has been connected to each other successfully.

   ```
   INFO|2017-11-22 17:16:32|Connected to 3 peers
   ```

   **（3）Verify the consensus mechanism**

   > Execute the following command on one of the servers:

   ```sh
   tail -f /bcos-data/node4_*/log/* | grep ++++
   ```

   > The following logs show that the nodes are reaching  consensus periodically.

   ```
